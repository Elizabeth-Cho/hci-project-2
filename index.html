    <h1>How can technology help education?</h1>
    <h5> Shichang Ke, Elizabeth Cho, Abdullah Yousuf</h5>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>One of the most drastic changes that this generation of students has experienced is the digitalization of
        classrooms. It's amazing to think that the form of the classroom has not changed for years, but right now it's
        undergoing a transformation gradually. Such a transformation was accelerated during the Covid years as students
        and instructors were forced to take the class online. Although now, three years after the pandemic, the campus
        is back to in-person again, we could not go back to the way it was before Covid. The online format of teaching
        seems to have become an integral part of the modern education system. Now, accessibility to a stable internet
        has become essential for students to receive an education (at least it is the case here at Johns Hopkins).
        Therefore, we thought it'd be valuable to analyze the historical data on technology and education to evaluate
        the correlation between them.</p>
    <h3>The internet has become a essential infrastructure in the world</h3>
    <p>In the early stages of the internet, accessibility was not as widely available. However, with technological
        developments, this access has become more widespread. Similarly, access to mobile cellular subscriptions has
        become more widely available. We wanted to initially assess the relationship between each country's GDP and the
        percentage of the population with access to the internet as well as the number of mobile cellular subscriptions
        per 100 people for 2000, 2018, and 2020 to assess trends when internet connections were not as necessary, before
        Covid, and during Covid.<br>

        In the 2000s, access to the internet was not as much of as a necessity as it is in more recent years and we see
        a stronger correlation between the country's GDP and the percentage of the population with access to the
        internet and the number of mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people. This correlation weakens in 2018 and
        2020, where a country's GDP is not as strong of an indicator of how much of the population has access to
        internet or cellular subscriptions. Overall, more people have access to these resources as the years have
        progressed and it has become prevalent in our lives.<br>

        In the maps below, countries that are colored in black may not have data available for that statistic.</p>

    <h3>Not the same level of improvement in accessibility to education</h3>
    <p>The internet has facilitated increased access to education. Traditionally, education has only been accessible to
        those enrolled in educational institutions, and only at certain times of the day and certain days of the week.
        With the advent of streaming videos on the internet, educational websites, like Khan Academy, have started to
        become household names. Besides Khan Academy, there are an enormous number of educational channels available on
        YouTube that teach anything from calculus to cooking. Nowadays, anyone with a sufficiently strong internet
        connection can learn from wherever they are and at any time without paying or enrolling in an educational
        institution. Despite this seemingly high availability to education via the internet, there are still some places
        in the world where a significant portion of primary-school-aged children are out of school as shown in the graph
        below, and there a number of possible causes for this problem. For one, children out of school may not have
        access to internet and technology to be able to learn at their convenience. Secondly, children do not generally
        have the discipline to sit and learn by themselves and require assistance from a teacher. This implies that,
        even with the internet, school is and will likely be the primary method of education for children all over the
        world.</p>

    <h3>Direct comparison between the two variables</h3>
    <p>Having looked at the accessibility to technology and to education separately, we thought it'd be more
        straightforward to put the two variables together. The graphs below represent people in different world regions'
        access to the internet and education in 2000 and 2020. We'd thought that since the tech sector and education
        have had more overlaps in recent years, the two variables would show a higher correlation in 2020. However, what
        the graphs have shown is that they had a higher correlation in 2000.</p>

        new Runtime().module(define, name => {
          if (name === "key") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-key-42ff50ea"));
          if (name === "groupChart") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-groupChart-42ff50ea"));
          if (name === "key1") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-key1-42ff50ea"));
          if (name === "groupChart1") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-groupChart1-42ff50ea"));
        });
        </script>
    <P>Perhaps it's clearer if we can play with the data a little bit. The y-axis of the two graphs below is the
        percentage of people with access to the internet. If we sort the bar by ascending order of percentage of
        enrollment, we can see that in 2000, the order of is very similar to the ascending order of accessibility to the
        internet. If we look at the graph in 2020, we do not see that much of a difference in the y-axis value of the
        bars if we sort it in the order of percentage of enrollment. It is rational when one thinks about the fact that
        the internet has transformed from a luxury good to a near necessity in just two decades, while education has not
        changed so much. Thus, in 2000, only people with higher incomes can have access to the internet and education.
        In 2020, the Internet has become more available to people with lower incomes, but people in poverty still rarely
        can receive an education.</P>

    <h3>Can the widespread usage of the internet helps promote access to education?</h3>
    <p>What has become clear from the data analysis is that there is only a weak relationship between accessibility to
        technology and education, at least a weaker one than we have thought of. It may be because the more recent
        open-source data is from 2020, the year when Covid started. If we have data that are more recent, we might see a
        strengthening in the relationship between them. Nevertheless, one thing worth thinking of is how we can exploit
        the widespread usage of the internet to promote education. In other words, how can the advance in technology
        help in providing high-quality, low-cost education to people around the world? We can see such an idea being
        carried out in higher education. For example, the Johns Hopkins Engineering for Professionals program offers
        online and part-time master’s degrees and certificates in 22 programs spanning multiple engineering disciplines
        and applied science. The program may not necessarily be low-cost, but it aims to provide a high-quality online
        learning experience. It'd worthwhile to explore ways the technology can help not only in universities but also
        in primary & secondary schools, especially schools in the third-world countries.</p>
    <h3>Ways to strengthen the impact of tech on education</h3>
    <p>Due to the possible consequences of technology use in classrooms, schools must take caution in how technology is
        integrated into lessons. Students can finish assignments, watch the latest sports matches, and message their
        friends all while sitting in lecture. In this way, technology distracts students from focusing on what is
        important. Furthermore, technology also allows students to multi-task, which does more harm than good by
        inhibiting focus on one particular task. In order to benefit from technology, educators have been adapting their
        courses and teaching style to use technology in ways that facilitate learning. For example, many educators have
        adopted a flipped classroom format -- this means students learn at home via videos and come to class to solve
        problems. This is beneficial to students because they get exposure to the subject at their convenience and build
        a better understanding by solving problems while getting immediate feedback from their instructor. According to
        results from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) from 2018, students with access to a
        computer they can use for schoolwork report higher scores in mathematics compared to students without access.
        The difference in average scores between having access to a computer that can be used for schoolwork and not
        having access is shown in the Y-axis of the scatterplot below. The X-axis indicates an index of computer usage
        (negative values do not indicate negative usage). The scatterplot shows that the difference in test scores from
        access to computers is increases with computer usage, but seems to decrease after a certain point. This suggests
        too much computer usage could be detrimental to education.</p>

    <script type="module">

        import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/d/361b8162b24ae278.js?v=3";
        new Runtime().module(define, name => {
          if (name === "tech_use_scatterplot") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-tech_use_scatterplot-7c637ff8"));
        });
        </script>

    <h3>Conclusion & analysis</h3>
    <p>With the increase in access to the internet in the past two decades, this has become almost a necessity instead
        of a luxury. There has been a weakening correlation between a country's GDP and the percentage of people with
        access to internet as well as number of mobile cellular subscriptions. There has also been an increase in
        quality educational resources available online, although the increased prevalence of these resources has not
        necessarily resulted in an increase in access to education. While more people in varying economic statuses have
        access to the internet, people with lower incomes still have decreased access to education.<br>

        Given the technologies developed during the pandemic to support online education, there are also opportunities
        to use these developments to increase access to education. These were initially developed to increase access to
        education when traditional, in person, forms were not as accessible. Despite the return to both in person and
        hybrid forms of education, we can continue to use these and it is promising to see the potential of applications
        of these technologies to increase accessibility to education regardless of economic status.<br>

        We acknowledge the fact that there are several factors that contribute to accessibility to education, but we can
        leverage the increase in access to internet and technology to help increase access to quality education.</p>
